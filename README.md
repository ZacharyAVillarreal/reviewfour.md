## Summary
# Mario Sunshine is a 3D platforming game where the player plays as mario with in a 3D world with a new major game mechanic. Mario has his usual moveset of jumping that he can use to move around the world but the new mechanic introduced is the FLOOD device which changes the way Mario can move around and interacts with the world. The FLOOD is a water pump that sprays water in directions that Mario can use to hit enemies or move in the air. The player starts with the abilities to spray water in a direction and spray water down to key Mario floating at the same height while water is in the tank. The FLOOD has a water tank that holds a limited amount of water. The tank can be refilled by jumping into water for a small amount of time and the tank will begin filling quickly. 
# The story for Mario Sunshine is Mario and his friends went to an island for vacation and a shadow Mario makes a mess of the resort and Mario gets blamed. Mario is then tasked with cleaning the island as his punishment and while cleaning the resort, Mario is searching for the shadow mario. Mario goes from different "worlds" cleaning different levels. "Worlds" in Mario Sunshine is just different area of the island that Mario and Mario has multiple levels in the area and can earn stars for completing the mission. 
# Mario's enemies are built around Mario's jumping mechanic and around the FLOOD. Most enemies die when Mario jumps on them but some are protected and when sprayed with FLOOD will flip or so something similar and Mario can then jump on them to defeat the enemies. Many bosses have a stage where you need to hit them somewhere with the FLOOD and then jump somewhere to remove a part of the boss or take life away from boss. 
## Final Thoughts
I liked the game overall, I did not find to many things to complain about outside of controls on the gamecube controller and the camera being a bit messy when up against walls.
